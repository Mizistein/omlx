"""
Hardware detection and system information for oMLX.

This module provides:
- Hardware detection for Apple Silicon
- System memory detection

Note: mlx-lm already includes optimized implementations internally:
- Flash Attention via mx.fast.scaled_dot_product_attention
- Efficient memory management
- Optimized Metal kernels

No additional optimization is needed - mlx-lm is already fast out of the box.

Usage:
    from omlx.optimizations import (
        detect_hardware,
        get_optimization_status,
    )
